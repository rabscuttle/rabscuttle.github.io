# Summary of Project
This website is part of our final project for the University of Minnesota Data Analytics bootcamp.  Our goal is to determine which of the machine learning models we learned in class can most accurately
predict the classification of an animal based on various provided attributes.  Our data comes from the Zoo Data Set that is part of the UCI Machine Learning repository.  It is a combination of the original data set along with an extension data set to add additional animals, for a total of 212 distinct animals. Visit our <a href = "https://rabscuttle.github.io/data.html">data page</a> to learn more about the data set.

We ran our data through multiple machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine.  We also built a neural network and experimented with K-Means, which is an unsupervised neural network, to see what kind of categories the model would create.
